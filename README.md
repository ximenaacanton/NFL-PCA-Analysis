## Introduction
NFL PCA Analysis is a Python program designed to evaluate the performance of machine learning models with and without dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The aim is to analyze the trade-offs between model complexity and clarity while retaining key features from the dataset.

## Technologies
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Scope of Functionalities
- Dimensionality Reduction: Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining 95% of the total variance.
- Model Evaluation: Compared the performance of logistic regression models with and without PCA.
- Visualization: Generated heatmaps, scree plots, and biplots to interpret PCA results and identify key features.

## Examples of Use
- Dimensionality Reduction: Demonstrated how PCA can simplify datasets while preserving significant information.
- Model Comparison: Highlighted the impact of dimensionality reduction on machine learning model performance.
- Visual Insights: Provided visualizations to better understand the relationship between features and outcomes.

## Project Status

Completed

## Sources
- This project was developed as part of a college coursework assignment for the Data Science and Mathematics program.
